In this POC of TCP Data Injection, we'll be using the following scenario.
Please read the code and replace IP/MAC with fields with the desired fields.

You can use SeedLabs to perform ARP Cache Poisoning. See here: https://seedsecuritylabs.org/

M = attacker
A = Host in network
B = Another Host in network
